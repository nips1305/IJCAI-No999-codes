This repository is our implementation of "HyReaL: Clustering Attributed Graph via Hyper-Complex Space Representation Learning".

## How to Run It

choose the specific dataset and execute it: 

```shell
sh run.sh
```

### Requirements 

The experiment is conducted on one NVIDIA 3090 GPU. And the requirements is following:

```
pytorch >= 1.6
scipy 
scikit-learn
numpy 
munkres
```
